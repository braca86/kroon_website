    text: 'Kroon team did a great job on our project. The project was for rebuilding an existing mobile app, but a lot of new functionality was added to existing functionality. The team communicates very well. They are flexible to opinions but also have strong ideas that made the process the effective (they won\'t just yes to your ideas, unless it make sense, but let you know in a nice way about why it is good/bad etc.). They picked our business domain very quick.',

    text: 'I want to give Kroon high praise for the work they\'ve done. They were a pleasure to work with!! I am the founder of a startup for personal budgeting and needed someone who could follow what I was saying - even though I may not have said it clearly. Kroon is incredible to work with! I had someone look at his previous work and they could tell that he was not one of these cookie cutter guys. I cannot tell you how important it is to have someone who can read between the lines.  We went back and forth over a few weeks on Skype sessions and Kroon always took full responsibility for the project turning out great. I cannot recommend them highly enough. The nature of what I was trying to do was extremely complicated. More than once we discussed how critical it is to think about the user experience and be sure you are not diminishing the customer journey.',
